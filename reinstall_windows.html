            <h3 class="post__title--heading">Reinstall Windows</h3>
            <h5 class="post__title--subhead">April 3, 2022</h5>
        </div>

        <div class="post__content">
            <div class="post__img-container--full">
                <img src="images/Screenshot (41).png" alt="Windows 10 Start Menu" class="post__image--full">
                <p class="post__img-caption">Windows 10 Start Menu with ads</p>
            </div>

            <p class="post__text">Recently my gaming laptop started to run out of space due to the number of games that
                are installed on it. The laptop came with a 512Gb NVMe SSD and that was quickly getting filled up. I
                purchased a new, 2 one and try Linux gaming; however, that did not work. Instead, the system would not
                recognize the SSD was there for boot, and I could only boot into Windows. I eventually gave up on that
                and decided that I would just replace the 512Gb one and install Windows on the new one. </p>
            <p class="post__text">Installing Windows 10 was about as anyone could expect. Everything went as expected,
                and I was once walking me through the process. Great, so I am through that process and finally have
                Windows on the computer, 2Tb of storage.</p>
            <p class="post__text">After the install came the updates. The updater immediately started installing updates
                up to 21H1, but nothing beyond that. I immediately saw an alert about Windows 11, but it was not the
                upgrade. It just was a link to a description about Windows 11 and whether the laptop is compatible, but
                not the upgrade. It took several days before the upgrade to Windows 11 finally came. </p>

            <div class="post__img-container--full">
                <img src="images/Screenshot (49).png" alt="Windows 11 Update notification" class="post__image--full">
                <p class="post__img-caption">Windows 11 Update notification</p>
            </div>

            <p class="post__text">Meanwhile, I was reintroduced to the intrusive advertising for applications Microsoft
                has partnered with as well as their own. I got the usual two different points where Microsoft pushed
                Edge when trying to download Chrome. Search for Chrome and the search will push Edge. Try to download
                Chrome and there is another pop-up. I also got ads for ‘Shopping on Edge’ with discounts when using it
                and I got an ad for free gift cards through Microsoft Rewards. If there was ever a reason to not want to
                use
                Edge as a browser, Microsoft shoving so many ads into the browser while using it is a great reason. I am
                sure
                there is a way to turn it off, but rather than search for a way to do that, I will just use Firefox.
            </p>
            <div class="post__img-container--full">
                <img src="images/Screenshot (42).png" alt="Windows 10 Edge Shopping ad" class="post__image--full">
                <p class="post__img-caption">Windows 10 Edge Shopping ad</p>
            </div>
            <div class="post__img-container--full">
                <img src="images/Screenshot (43).png" alt="Bing Search Edge ad" class="post__image--full">
                <p class="post__img-caption">Bing search Edge ad</p>
            </div>
            <div class="post__img-container--full">
                <img src="images/Screenshot (44).png" alt="Edge ad" class="post__image--full">
                <p class="post__img-caption">Edge ad</p>
            </div>
            <div class="post__img-container--full">
                <img src="images/Screenshot (50).png" alt="Xbox ad" class="post__image--full">
                <p class="post__img-caption">Xbox ad</p>
            </div>
            <p class="post__text">The other area is the start menu. There are a series of applications which are not
                technically installed until you click on them. So, if you are someone that uses the start menu, as I am,
                or just someone that wants it to look clean, you have to go through the process of deleting all of
                these. But it is worse, because post the upgrade to Windows 11, a bunch of applications are back. Again,
                I have to remove applications from the start menu.</p>


            <p class="post__text">In the end, this laptop is primarily for gaming, and I will do very little browsing
                while using it. I am glad that I am not using Windows regularly for anything. While Windows 11 is nice
                to look at it, it is still Windows.
