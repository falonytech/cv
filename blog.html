                <p class="bloglist__preview">Recently, I took my family on vacation, and decided to bring a pared down set of tech with me. I am going 
                    to walk through some of my experiences with the tech that I brought, though I have to admit that I did not get a whole lot of time to utilize 
                    any of it. </p>

                <p class="bloglist__preview">In two weeks, I will be going on vacation with my wife and son. This will be the first real trip that we have 
                    taken since he was born a little more than a year ago. As I gear up for this trip, I am evaluating what technology I will be taking with 
                    me. This trip is focused on a lot of non-technology related activities, and I donâ€™t think that I will have a lot of time to play around on 
                    the computer. My forearm will appreciate the break from typing every day. But I still plan on having a few items around in case we are 
                    sitting around the hotel, and I can get a chance to jump online. </p>

                <p class="bloglist__preview">I have been using Microsoft Office 365 for more than 30 days now, and I have a few updates and a new part of the ecosystem to talk about. Office 365 is

                <p class="bloglist__preview">My subscription to Office 365 is coming up for renewal. My wife uses Office regularly and wanted to keep it. Office is not directly available on 
                    Linux, which is what I use, but I do prefer it for spreadsheets and documents. Since I am already paying for Office 365, the though occured to me, why not make use of 
                    all of the services that come with the subscription, including the cloud storage, Office Online, etc. And if I am going to try Office online and the cloud storage, I thought
                    it would be fun to take it the next step further and try out Microsoft applications for Android, iOS, and with my Windows desktop. I will be testing out the way it can integrate
                    into my daily flow, across many different systems, including Linux.</p>

                <p class="bloglist__preview">To cap off 2020, I finally completed the rebuild of my customer desktop tower. Over the past couple of years I upgraded the CPU to a Ryzen 1800X,
                    updated the motherboard to match, bought newer RAM that would work with the new motherboard, and upgraded to a 500Gb M.2 SSD. While the parts are a little older, they are still 
                    very nice parts, and 2020 was the time to complete the build. On December 26th, I installed a Radeon RX580. While this card is not new to the market, it is a huge upgrade
                    over the Radeon HD 6850 I have been using up until this point.</p>

                    of the stories about this thing overheating, especially the model I got with the 4gb of RAM.  decided to get the Cana Kit for $99, which 
                    came with a power switch, a plastic case (pictured), a micro-HDMI to HDMI cable, and several small heatsinks for the chips with a fan 
                    that is positioned on the top of the case. These are my thoughts on performance, quality, and overall satisfaction.</p>
