            </div>

            <div class="post__content">
                <p class="post__text">I have always owned a personally built, desktop PC since college, when my father sent me to school with the familyâ€™s old Gateway PC running Windows 98. At the time, I attempted to install Windows XP on it, realized it was unable to do so competently, and set about using my money to buy PC parts individually. 
                    I have gone through a lot of different builds throughout the years, starting small with an Intel Pentium 4 CPU and super excited when I finally had a board that support AGP graphics cards. </p>

                </div>
                
                <p class="post__text">Cute kitten aside, you can see the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/silver-lian-li-v-cool-atx-mid-tower/p/N82E16811112051">Lian Li computer case</a> in the background at my first apartment. With that build I was using an <a href="https://www.newegg.com/amd-athlon-ii-x3-440/p/N82E16819103843?Item=N82E16819103843">AMD Athalon 3-core CPU</a>
                    , a <a href="https://www.newegg.com/sapphire-radeon-hd-5770-100283l/p/N82E16814102858?Item=N82E16814102858">Sapphire Radeon HD 5770 graphnics card</a>, and probably 4Gb of RAM. The case itself was great and the Mac style build quality was something I was looking for. I cannot say my cable management at the time was on point, 
                    but this case did not have a window in the side. Trying to go back and find pictures of my old computers was far more challenging that I thought it would be, and this was the best shot that I could come up with.</p>
                <p class="post__text">I sold that computer when I fell on some hard times and needed the money. That left me without a desktop computer for a while, until the itch to build a new computer hit me again in 2012 and I wanted to be able to play Skyrim. I purchased an <a href="https://www.newegg.com/amd-phenom-ii-x4-960t/p/N82E16819103995?Item=N82E16819103995">AMD Phenom Quad-core CPU</a>,

Nothing fancy,
                    but it got the job done for years.</p>
                <p class="post__text">Six years later, in 2018, I finally decided to upgrade my desktop computer. I purchased an <a href="">AMD Ryzen 7 1800X</a>, <a href="">16Gb of RAM</a>, but kept the same 6850 graphics card. All this was combined in a <a href="https://www.newegg.com/black-red-sharkoon-ai7000-atx-mid-tower/p/2AM-0040-00027?Item=9SIAAGV61E5518">Sharkoon case</a>. A new laptop was more 
                    important to me as I was getting more into web development. I spent time working on development while on the couch, next to my wife, and having a setup where I could plug my laptop up and use dual screens, and unplug it to use mobile was most important. For gaming, I had an XBox One. The graphics card upgrade was put off until now. </p>

                <p class="post__text">The installation was super easy. I anticipated needing to improve my cable management, thinking that this card would be longer that the 6850, but it was not. The card fit neatly in place.</p>
                <p class="post__text ">The Radeon RX 580 was released in 2017; it is not the most up-to-date, but for me it is a huge improvement. It is at least six to seven years more recent than the previous card I was using. 
                    I am super happy to have a newer card and look forward to testing it out. While I am unable to do a lot of gaming any longer, I plan on setting asside some time to get something newer and test the card. Eventually
                    I would love to get a VR headset and try it with that.

                <p class="post__text">Right now the tower is hooked up to the small screen on the right. I use the dual screens for the laptop setup and do not want to go back to KVM switches. Eventually I will get a newer screen for gaming, 
                    but my first upgrade on screens will come to the laptop/dock setup. I use my laptop a lot more, and that setup also supports my work laptop for when I work from home. Another thing occured to me while writing this post. 
                    I have been using AMD processors and graphics cards almost a decade. And specifically, Sapphire graphics cards. I have to recommend their cards given my history with them.
